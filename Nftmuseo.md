# NFTmuseo.com 

## Project Overview
NFT digital art is becoming increasingly popular. This web application will be a simple, easy-to-use social media platform that will allow its users to share their NFT's with the public and build connections with other NFT hobbyists on the site. At this time, very few web applications exist that are dedictated to allowing NFT holders to gain exposure of their NFT's in a social media setting. 
 
## Functionality

**Homepage**
